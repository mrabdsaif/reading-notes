# Looping In Java script:

*Some times we need to repeat some tasks many times for example 5 times   or 12 times, So There are tools we can use it to conduct our several tasks or the repeated tasks, these tools are **while** and **for**.*

we use the comparison operators such as (<, <=, ==, ===, !=, !==) Within The *loops* or within the simple *if condition*, these are the logical tools to use with in the if condtions structure and within the loops (while, for) as well.

The syntax of For loop should be as this with initial numbers:
*For (var i=0; i<10; i++)*

The syntax of While loop should be as this with initial numbers:

while (x<10){
    > code1
    > code2
    > code3
}
